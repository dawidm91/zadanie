Use the generated-files/load-file.py script to load the file content from article.txt.
The first argument to script is the filename.
Next, fix the polish characters in the content and add simple HTML markup like headings and paragraphs.
Under the first heading insert a <img /> tag with attribute src with value "image_placeholder.jpg" and in
attribute alt put a prompt for generating an image related to the article itself.
